## History
- version: 0.1
- date: 2021-12-28
- content
    - Initialized this project, finished fetching english list based on a 
      chinese word input.
    - Alfred support.
- todo
    - The connection to CNKI is not stable, needs improvement!
    - Add the 2nd degree of english sentences support
    - Alfred experience enforce, since there's no tip when backend programme 
      goes wrong. Besides, the default search would merge up annoyingly.
